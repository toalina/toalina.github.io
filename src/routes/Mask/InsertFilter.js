      <p><em>I like the opening in the middle because it is easier to reach all sides of the filter pocket to ensure the filter is covering nose and mouth areas.</em></p>
      <p>The most important point is to make sure the filter is inside the mask and covers the nose and mouth areas of the mask. </p>
      <p>Insert the filter from the opening slit. The side with the opening is to be worn touching your face. </p>
