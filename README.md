### To run app locally:

### Work flow!
- Delete `/build` folder from previous build before pushing to `master`
- Branch off `master`
- Develop on `feature` branch
- npm run build
- Push up `/build` folder and static content
- Open Pull Request to merge `feature` branch `/build` folder content into `master`
- Git pull from `master`
- Deploy from `master`

*!!!DO NOT PULL from `master`!!!*

*Master branch should only have static files!*
